Rear View mirror - Check for guy on motorcycle. If you see him, DO NOT look out the window, he will stab you
You drift on the road, so you need to occassionally click and hold the steering wheel.
Maybe there will be something in the road, honk the horn??
Need some reason to look out the window... 
The radio will occassionally do something... maybe change on its own... maybe you hear a voice? 
	This is a negative signal. Looking at the radio at this time WILL kill you (jumpscare in road?)
